# Syntax_Notebook
This notebook documents sytax of programming language

### Markdown

1. Some syntax cannot be viewed on github page. I would recommend you to download and view it through Visual Studio Code.
      
2. The following extensions in Visual Studio Code are also very useful:
- **Markdown All in One**: All you need for Markdown (keyboard shortcuts, table of contents, auto preview and more)
- **Markdown Preview Enhanced**: Markdown Preview Enhanced is an extension that provides you with many useful functionalities such as automatic scroll sync, math typesetting, mermaid, PlantUML, pandoc, PDF export, code chunk, presentation writer, etc. A lot of its ideas are inspired by Markdown Preview Plus and RStudio Markdown.
- **Markdown Preview Mermaid Support**: Adds Mermaid diagram and flowchart support to VS Code's builtin markdown preview
- **Mermaid Markdown Syntax Highlighting**
- **Markwon TOC**: A Visual Studio Code extension that generates a table of contents for your markdown file.
